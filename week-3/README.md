# Week 3

## Prep Work

### WireFrames

* [What are these things?](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=what+are+wireframes)
* [Why are these so great?](https://medium.com/@ray_vevaina/wireframing-a-front-end-developers-best-friend-c541df51ea65)
* [wireframe.cc - online wireframes](https://wireframe.cc/)

### Git, GitHub & GitKraken

This module's main objective is to learn how Git & GitHub can be used to organize your development process.  Come prepared for Sunday's activities by studying these links:

* [git & github for poets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV)
* [LearnGitBranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) & [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG0ke9vILQM) - complete the first set of exercises
* [Familiarize yourself with GitKraken](https://support.gitkraken.com/start-here/interface/)
* [Study this example project](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/built-with-branches)
* [Understand how to use Atomic Commits](https://curiousprogrammer.io/blog/how-to-craft-your-changes-into-small-atomic-commits-using-git)

## Assignments

This week there is 1 project, and 2 exercise sets.

### Project

> [Code-Along](http://hackyourfuture.be/homework-submission/#projects)

This week's project is to build your own accessible & responsive clone of the [DuckDuckGo home page](https://duckduckgo.com).  We don't expect your DOM to be identical to DuckDuckGo's, but the rendered site should be visually as close as possible. Unlike the last two weeks, this project does not have a video tutorial for you to follow.  You're on your own! Here are some skills that will come in handy:
* [Finding which colors a website uses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Inspect_and_select_colors)
* [Which fonts a website uses](https://wpshout.com/quick-guides/how-to-see-what-fonts-a-website-is-using/)
* [Which images a website uses](https://www.lifewire.com/copy-image-web-address-url-1174175)

You will be expected to turn in your code for this project on a new repository, cleanly developed with __one branch per page section__.  Take a look through [this example repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/built-with-branches) to get an idea of what an incrementally developed project looks like.  Be sure to also clone this repository and study it using GitKraken/VSC/Browser to explore what happens when you check out different branches.

You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, and the completeness of your repository. Your repository must contain:

* A README describing the project and a report on what you struggled with, what you learned, and what skills you need to practice further.
* One well-named branch per user story. If we check out any branch, it should contain _only_ the code necessary to make that step work. and it should work!
* A file called `user-stories.md` in which you explain how you broke the project into steps, describe the step as a _user story_, and what you named the branch for that step.
* A file called `wireframe.md` that will include an explanation and a link to your wireframe saved on [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc).

But wait! Before you dive right in, take a minute to set up your homework on the module project board:

1. Start an empty repository called ```duck-duck-clone``` (Named _exactly_ this!)
1. Create an issue for this week's project & exercises, then move it to the board.
1. Open [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)
1. Get started!

### Exercises

There are 2 sets of exercises to start (and hopefully finish).

* In [HTML-CSS-Practice-Problems](https://github.com/DevMountain/HTML-CSS-Practice-Problems):
  * Complete the exercises in `./level-3`
  * Push your work regularly, so you can ask questions with issues!
* In [css-exercises](https://github.com/dangodev/css-exercises)
  * Complete `exercise-6` and `exercise-8`
  * Push your work regularly, so you can ask questions with issues!
